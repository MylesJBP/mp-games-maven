A mini-project for Grinnell's CSC-207.

Authors:

* Myles Bohrer-Purnell
* Sebastian Manza
* Samuel A. Rebelsky (Starter code)

Instructions:

        1. Enter a length of word between 2-12 letters.
        2. Enter a maximum number of guesses for a word.
        3. Enter your starting word:
          If the letter has (G) after it, it is in the word and is in the correct spot.
          If the letter has (Y) after it, it is in the word, but in the incorrect spot.
          Otherwise the letter is not in the word.
          Note that yellows will display multiple times even if there is only one
          occurence of the letter in the word.
        4. With that knowledge, enter your next guess.
